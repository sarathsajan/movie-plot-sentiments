avatar = plot = "In 2154, humans have depleted Earth's natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral  unobtanium  on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system.[10] Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids[34] that live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa.To explore Pandora's biosphere, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called avatars, operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While escorting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a thanator and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's private security force, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,[35] which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,[36] and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the biological neural network native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a pre-emptive strike against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls."
#titanic = plot = "In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team board the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh to search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.[Note 1] Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and allow them to retain their upper-class status. Distraught over the engagement, Rose climbs over the stern and contemplates suicide; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first-class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Cal retaliates by having Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket and accusing him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the master-at-arms' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose realizes that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, dropping the stern into the water. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia[8] but Rose is saved.With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all of his money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929.Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean, which was in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed,[9] photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the Titanic's Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died on the ship."
#joker = plot = "In 1981, party clown Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in Gotham City. Gotham is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving segments of the population disenfranchised and impoverished.

After a gang attacks him in an alley, Arthur's co-worker, Randall, lends him a gun. Arthur invites his neighbor, single mother Sophie, to his stand-up comedy show, and they begin dating.While entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Arthur is fired and Randall lies that Arthur bought the gun himself.

#drishyam = plot = "Georgekutty (Mohanlal) is an orphan who had dropped out of school after his 4th grade. Now he is a businessman running a cable TV service in a rural area. He is married to Rani (Meena) and they have two daughters, Anju (Ansiba Hassan) and Anu (Esther Anil). His only interest apart from his family is watching films. He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office.During a nature camp, Anju gets photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone. The culprit, Varun (Roshan Basheer), is the son of police inspector general Geetha Prabhakar (Asha Sarath). Varun is accidentally killed by Rani and her daughter when he comes to blackmail them.

Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.Geetha arrests Georgekutty and family and Sahadevan uses brute force to beat the truth out of them.

#manichitrathazhu = plot = "A young couple, Ganga and Nakulan, arrives at Nakulan's ancestral home tharavadu called Madampalli. Hailing from a family that follows tradition and superstitions, Nakulan's uncle Thampi objects to the couple's idea of moving into the allegedly haunted mansion, which Nakulan ignores. The couple moves in, following which seemingly supernatural events begin to occur.The mansion was occupied in ancient times by Sankaran Thampi, a feudal lord of the province who was also the karanavar (head) of the tharavadu. In his heyday, he had brought in a dancer, Nagavalli, from Tamil Nadu as his concubine. But she was already in love with a man named Ramanathan, a dancer who came along with her secretly and settled in a house beside the mansion. Learning of their affair and their plan to elope, Sankaran Thampi murders Nagavalli in her room at the mansion. Legend has it that on the eighth day of Navaratri, on Durgashtami night (an annual Hindu celebration), Nagavalli returned as a blood-thirsty spirit, intent on killing the chieftain and drinking his blood, but he was saved upon chanting some mantras. With the assistance of sorcerers, Thampi escaped from the wrath of Nagavalli. Her spirit was locked in the South side of the mansion (Thekkini) by placing a talisman over the lock. Later Sankaran Thampi committed suicide and his spirit was locked up in the same Thekkini, by means of an ornate enchanted lock called manichitrathazhu.Ganga manages to unlock the Thekkini, only to find ancient valuables such as jewellery, musical instruments etc. Upon learning about the unlocking of the Thekkini, fearing the spirits are on the loose, Nakulan's uncle Thampi and family move into the mansion to try and re-seal the Thekkini lock, while also looking out for Nakulan and Ganga. However, various unclear sightings of a woman are witnessed around the mansion, along with attempted attacks on various people at the mansion, including Nakulan's cousin Alli and his wife Ganga. While most of the family including Thampi believe that Nagavalli's ghost roams the mansion, Nakulan, disapproving of supernatural theories, suspects Sreedevi, Thampi's daughter, of being mentally ill, hence orchestrating the incidents at the mansion. Hearing of this, Thampi and the family fear that Sreedevi might be possessed by Nagavalli's spirit.Sreedevi, Nakulan's cousin and Thampi's daughter, according to tradition, was to be married to Nakulan; however, after finding that Sreedevi had an ominous horoscope, Nakulan's mother withdrew from this proposal, and got Nakulan married to Ganga; later, Sreedevi entered a marriage which was short-lived. Sreedevi's tragic history, along with her perceived gloominess, and her being the only person present during an attack on Ganga, lays cause for suspicion of her.Dr. Sunny Joseph, a brilliant yet frolicsome Psychiatrist and Nakulan's close friend is called from the USA to investigate. Soon enough Dr. Sunny finds out that Nakulan's conclusions are not as obvious and he uncovers a plan to commit a murder during the upcoming Durgashtami Festival. Sunny's trained psychiatric mind begins to suspect that Ganga could well be the mental patient of Madampilly. He investigates Ganga's childhood and past. Ganga grew up in a highly superstitious family and had partaken in various religious rituals as a child. Her parents had left her to her grandmother as a 3 year old and never bothered about her due to their busy lifestyle. This made her sensitive as an individual; so when she came to know that her parents were moving her to Calcutta she was unable to come to grips with it. She had become very close to her grandmother and didn't want to leave her village and her ancestral home. It was a period of great emotional and psychological turmoil for her, and she became afflicted with multiple personality disorder. Madampilly with its share of superstitions and dark tales evokes memories of the childhood days in her, and she slowly develops the personality of Nagavalli after having empathised with her.Meanwhile, Nakulan's uncle, Thampi, having lost faith in Dr. Sunny, calls in a renowned tantric expert Pullattuparambil Brahmadattan Namboothiripad to rid his family of the supernatural menace. As fate has it, both the Namboothirippad and Dr. Sunny are old acquaintances and mutually admire each other's expertise in their respective fields. At his own risk, Sunny reveals the secret to Nakulan though he hides some of facts which he observed from Ganga's alter ego behaviour.When Ganga transforms into Nagavali, her alter ego assumes the man staying in old Ramanathan's house as Ramanathan which unfortunately was Mahadevan who was fiance of Alli. So as she assumes Nakulan to be the cruel Karnavar- Sankaran Thampi, thereby waits till Durgastami night to take revenge on him. These kind of associating mystical codes, Ganga's alter-ego picked from the tales and family connections of the house.In one of the more memorable scenes of the movie, Ganga also gets to know about her illness during a manifestation of her hidden personality, that of Nagavalli. Sunny, with help of the Namboothirippad, plans an elaborate Tantric ceremony to invoke Ganga's Nagavalli persona and make it believe that it will finally be able to kill Sankaran Thampi. The plan is put into action and in a fiery climax, the blood thirsty Nagavalli exacts revenge on the cruel Karanavar, Sankaran Thampi, by making Nakulan lie down on a platform, and giving a sword to Nagavalli. As Nagavalli is about to pick up the sword, Sunny turns the platform upside down, thereby revealing a blood-filled dummy, which resembled the Karanavar. Thus, Nakulan is saved, and he escapes, and watches the scene. Ganga, in her extreme rage, as Nagavalli, thinks that she actually kills the Karanavar, and drinks the dummy's blood, thereby making her feel like she has accomplished her task. Ganga falls down into a hypnotic sleep.Ganga wakes up from her hypnotic sleep and learns that she is completely cured of the illness. Sunny expresses his intent to marry Sreedevi, and they all drive off happily."
#lucifer = plot = "At Interpol's head office in France, an officer is looking at reports about Khureshi-Ab'ram on his computer—an unidentified entity involved in transcontinental trade. A message from the Central Intelligence Agency pops up, about a suspected diamond-gold nexus working in tandem with the warlords of Africa. An image believed to be of Ab'ram's is received, taken in Istanbul on 7 April 2006. The officer immediately dials Interpol's secure phone line and says: 'Flag it off. Its Abram. Khureshi-Abram'.Meanwhile, in Kerala, the chief minister P. K. PKR Ramdas has died. Leader of the ruling party, Indian Union Front (IUF), PKR died at the Medayil Institute of Medical Science and Research, which happens to be the hospital owned by the daughter of the opposition party's (RPI[M]) leader, Medayil Rajan's. Taking advantage of the situation, the acting chief minister, Mahesha Varma, directs party activists to form a riot outside the hospital, uttering slogans accusing Rajan of murder, believing it would benefit in the upcoming elections.Govardhan, a mysterious man who identifies himself as a truth-seeker, records a Facebook live stream, in which he condemns those who praise PKR, claiming he was a puppet during his final years in the hands of a financial syndicate that holds the Indian political system. He claims that the IUF party has double the money the state's treasury has and warns the viewers that the person who will replace PKR is crucial. He lists five possible candidates—Priyadarshini Priya Ramdas, Bimal Bobby Nair, Jathin Ramdas, Mahesha Varma, and Stephen Nedumpally.From Govardhan's narration, Priya and Jathin are PKR's daughter and son, respectively. Priya, not involved in active politics, has a college-going daughter, Jhanvi, who she had with her first husband Jayadevan, who died in a questionable car accident in Dubai seven years ago. A year after the accident, she married an NRI, Bobby. Bobby was involved with real estate and Hawala scams blemishing PKR's goodwill. Jathin lives in the US and is completely uninvolved in politics. Other than his existence, Jathin's whereabouts are unknown to the public. Varma is the most likely successor with his seniority, known particularly for his lobbying skills. Stephen is an upstart promoted by PKR and a name not known until the last six years. Govardhan describes him as the most dangerous among them and calls him Lucifer. Little is known about his past other than his contract work for post-war reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan and gold smuggling from Dubai to Mattancherry, information retrieved from Govardhan's dark web research. Govardhan questions why PKR endorse a person with such records by consorting him in every meetings and conference, even vacating his consecutively winning Nedumpally assembly seat for him last year.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Bobby meets an acquaintance, Abdul, Bobby tells him that the medical report has not arrived, but everything is under control. He reveals PKR had called him a month ago to intimidate him in an attempt to stop his illegal drug trade. Bobby plans to fund the IUF party, replacing the present financier Manappattil Chandy by offering three times over, by way of illegal drug trafficking. With the help of Abdul, Bobby cuts a deal with the drug lord Fyodor. Fyodor agrees to transfer ₹250 crore every month in exchange of allowing unchecked Z-category drugs into Kerala once the IUF wins the election. But for the deal to proceed, Bobby has to first set up a drug production facility in Kerala. Abdul insists it should be in the government-sealed timber factory in Nedumpally range.At the same time, the cremation ceremony of PKR is carried out in Kerala. Priya asks Varma to forbid Stephen from the ceremony. On Varma's orders, commissioner Mayilvahanam attempts hindering his way but fails. In the absence of Jathin—last informed to be on a camping trip, Priya performs the rituals which were supposed to have performed by Jathin. After the ceremony, Bobby arrives home and unbeknownst to Priya, secretly gives Jhanvi Malana cream. Bobby convenes a meeting with the IUF ministers, informing his decision to fund the party and dissolve the current ministry to prepone the election to take advantage on the present sympathy wave, nominating Jathin as the party's next chief minister candidate.Chandy is known to be Stephen's ally. On the advice of Varma, Bobby attempts to reconcile with Stephen, but Stephen objects to funding the party with drug money and threatens Bobby against it. Enraged, Bobby assigns Sanjeev, the chief of IUF funded news channel NPTV, to conduct a smear campaign against Stephen. A reporter, Riju, is sent to Govardhan to collect evidence for his claims. But it happens he does not have any but claims Chandy is backed by the Khureshi-Ab'ram gang, a nexus that controls the gold-diamond trade in the world. He hands over a file named Govardhan's X-Files containing pieces of evidence against Bobby. Sanjeev delivers this to Bobby. Govardhan is captured by IUF activist Murugan and is unwillingly confined to an asylum.Bobby sends a group to the timber factory. Stephen, on knowing it kills six of them and single-handedly defeats the others. Stephen's aide Aloshy espy and reports the incident to Bobby, revealing himself as a mole. Mayilvaahanam, was sent to detect evidence from the premise but finds nothing. Later, Bobby, from Priya's diary, finds that she despises Stephen because her father gave more care for him, who was brought to their home as a child and was the cause for a rift between her parents. Stephen runs Ashrayam, a destitute home. Aloshy persuades one of the inmates, Aparna to slander Stephen. On NPTV's show, she accuses Stephen of raping her and conduct of other illegal activities. This creates public outrage against Stephen, who is arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Stephen gets a phone call from Zayed Masood, a mercenary and Stephen's confidant.Jathin arrives in the state and impresses the public with his speech. While transferring the fund to Bobby, Fyodor's containers are attacked and the money is destroyed by Zayed and his cohorts, who demand the release of Stephen. Disobeying Bobby, Varma meets Rajan to arrange a hit on Stephen by his party goons in prison, though Stephen easily defeats them. Varma left with no choice, releases him. Meanwhile, Jhanvi is hospitalised after an LSD overdose. Mayilvaahanam blackmails Priya for sex in exchange for not filing a case against Jhanvi. From Jhanvi, Priya comes to know about Bobby's lustful behaviour towards her. Bobby unhesitatingly admits to it and intimidates Priya with exposing Jhanvi's contacts with drug peddlers and threatens to cast away her and Jhanvi as he cast away PKR and Jayadevan. Meanwhile, Aparna admits on NPTV that she lied about Stephen.With no other choice, Priya seeks the help of Stephen, who vows to protect them. Stephen's men kill Mayilvaahanam. He meets with Sanjeev to clear NPTV's debts, taking control of the channel. Jathin and Priya convene a press conference to expose Bobby's illegal trades. Jathin tells Bobby that he came not because he asked, but on Stephen's orders. Bobby is held in Mumbai by Fyodor's men. Before Fyodor could kill him, Zayed and gang kill them, rescuing Bobby for Stephen to kill. Revealing himself to be Stephen's spy, Murugan kills Aloshy. Govardhan is released and reunited with his wife and daughter. Jathin is elected as the new chief minister. In a remote location in Russia, Stephen meets Zayed and gang and attends a phone call of a gold-diamond merchant Sanghani, to whom he introduces himself as Khureshi-Ab'ram. In the closing credits, headlines of various international newspapers are shown reporting Ab'ram as the head of an Illuminati society."
